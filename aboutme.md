title: About me
---

My name is Raghul Kannan and I am a Junior at Michigan State University pursing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a Minor in Business! My passion for Computer Science stems from my love for logic and problem-solving. Reach out to me through email or on linkedin if you are looking to chat.

### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
